# aliaz
An order creator usable from the terminal
Allows you to facilitate order creation under linux

# Languages available :
~~French (fr-FR)~~

English (en_EN)

# Informations
The program will install:
Zenity and Yad (which is an addition of zenity functionality).

# Installation
<pre style=" border: 1px solid black; padding:10px">
git clone https://github.com/72y9op/aliaz 
cd ~/aliaz/ 
mv mkalias /usr/local/bin/ 
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkalias
rmdir ~/aliaz/
</pre>
For the rest, you can add a keyboard shortcut to be able to create an order quickly, or leave the command usable only from the terminal
(Advice: I advise you the shortcut CTRL + Â²)
